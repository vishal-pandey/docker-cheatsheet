### Dockerfile

Dockerfile is used to create images which in turn can be used to create containers.

- `#` - for comments

- `FROM` - tells docker, from which base image you want to base your image from

- `RUN` - run instructions against the image

- `CMD command param1` - execute a command at runtime when the container is executed 

- `ENV key value` - set environment variables in the container

- `WORKDIR dirname` - set the working directory of the container

- `docker build  -t ImageName:TagName dir` - Build image from dockerfile, -t for tagging, dir for location of Dockerfile

### DockerCompose

Docker Compose is used to run multiple containers as a single service without the need to start each one separately.

- `docker-compose.yml` - filename for docker compose

- `docker-compose version` - details of the version of docker compose
